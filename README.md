Bookmark_Extension

A simple browser extension, that provides the ability to add the current tab's url to the extension. It also provides the choice to manually add any url to the extension.
This extension is also known as lead's tracker. This project was built with JavaScript, CSS and HTML along with the support of Chrome's tab API.

If you wish to add the extension to your own browser, it is very easy. Just download the files as zip. Extract it to a folder. Now open your browser, and go to extensions.
From there, enable developer mode. Now you can click the 'load unpacked' option, which asks you to upload the folder you extracted earlier. Upload it, and turn on the extension.
There you go, the extension is now available on your browser.
